# Gallifrey

Provide the best possible service to our customers and ourselves
via "mastery of time & space" (understanding past actions and
rapidly molding ourselves for better future positioning)

And it's a cool name for a project consisting of lots of related
themes :)

The overarching vision for the Gallifrey effort is to address
potential and actual customer problems as far "left" in the
support flow as possible.

Implementation focus is on Correctness, Determinism, and Efficiency

## Components

### Tardis
Enable rapid historical analysis, visualization, hypothesis
testing, classification of users, and understanding of "support
flow".

### (Component name TBD)
Beautiful Visualization for flows & classification over time

### Common_syntax
Syntactic sugars for common idioms and patterns, likely to be
reused by most or all other components.  These are typically
enriched onto existing types.

### Maxine
Help improve our own lives by understanding where OUR time is
being collectively poorly spent.  Reclaim our time!

## Notes
### IDE support
Dave uses Intellij with Bazel, Scala, and ZIO plugins. Currently
you'll want `Intellij 2020.2` so the bazel plugin is compatible.

Dave has a semantic highlighing scheme available to make the IDE
much more useful.  Contact on slack or `dave.nicponski@robinhood.com`
if you want it.
